Although QuickBooks is designed for the layperson to understand, the initial setup and installation must be done correctly in order for future information to be accurate.

All information necessary to set up manual accounting records is also necessary to set up and install QuickBooks on your desktop. This task is even more complicated if you switch from manual accounting operations to QuickBooks in the middle of the year.

Which accounting method will you use? What chart of accounts do you need for your business? How do you handle beginning balances?

An expert can easily answer all of these questions and complete the initial setup and Installation in a timely manner. In addition, your accounting employees receive training on the accounting software to enhance their performance.

**How Much Does It Cost?**

We first want to find out a little more about your business and your accounting records before we quote you an exact price. Rest assured that we work with many small business owners and our rates are designed to fit the budgets of our clients.
