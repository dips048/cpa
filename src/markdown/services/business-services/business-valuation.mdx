**Business Valuation Services: What’s Your Business Worth?**
------------------------------------------------------------

Many business owners have no idea what their business is worth; some may underestimate whereas others overestimate - sometimes significantly. Obtaining a third-party business valuation allows business owners to set a price that is realistic, yet still, achieves maximum value.

There are many reasons a business owner might want to obtain a business valuation:

*   Selling a business
*   Obtaining seed money from investors
*   Annual or quarterly reports to investors
*   Divorce proceedings
*   Estate, gift and trust planning
*   Shareholder disputes
*   Litigation support for bankruptcy, fraud, and business disputes
*   Mergers and acquisitions
