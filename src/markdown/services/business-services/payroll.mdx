**Cost-Effective Payroll Services for Your Business**
-----------------------------------------------------

On average, small business owners spend eight hours per month on payroll-related tasks. While it may not seem like a lot of time, it does add up--and it takes time away from running your business.

If you own a small to medium-sized business with more than a few employees, you already know that payroll is complicated. It seems like every year a new piece of federal, state, or local legislation related to payroll is passed that you need to comply with.

If you’re just starting out, you may only have a few employees to worry about. You might be able to handle payroll on your own, but wouldn’t your time be better spent on developing new products or services for your business?
