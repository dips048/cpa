**Helping You Build the Foundation for a Successful Business**
--------------------------------------------------------------

The decision to start a new business is an exciting one, but as every experienced business owner knows, there’s more to it than developing a product and hoping it sells. As an entrepreneur, you’re probably a "big picture" person with a vision. You'd rather not deal with nitty-gritty details like choosing a business entity, sales and payroll tax, or accounting systems that help you manage cash flow. The good news is that we're here to help you figure it out.

### What We Do for You:

*   Determine which business entity best meets your goals and minimizes tax liability
*   Partnership agreements
*   Prepare a cash flow budget
*   Create a business plan to help you secure financing (if needed)
*   Set up an accounting system using software that works for you
*   Create billing systems and implement policies and procedures for collections
*   Make sure you are compliant with state, local, and federal tax laws such as sales and use tax, payroll tax, and Federal EIN (Employer Identification Number)
*   Prepare annual tax returns and quarterly estimated taxes as needed
*   Assist you in filing paperwork for state and local licenses and permits as required
*   Assess your business insurance needs

### Planning for Success - and Profit

The keys to a successful - and profitable - business are meticulous planning and a methodical approach to running your business. Failing to do this in the initial stages of business formation is often a recipe for disaster, and it's the reason most businesses fail. Don’t let it happen to you.
