## **A Tax Headache Is Only One Mistake Away**

Every year, Congress promises to simplify the tax code, but every year, the tax code seems to become more complicated than ever. If you’ve tried tax preparation software and found it confusing, you’re not alone. As the tax code becomes more complex, so does tax preparation software -- and you might not be getting all of the tax breaks you’re entitled to.

Here’s something else you might not know: When you use tax software, you might not understand what’s on those forms you sent to the IRS. If the IRS audits your return, do you know that your tax preparation software is not liable -- you are. Why take a chance?
