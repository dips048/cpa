**Failing to File Your Tax Return Is a Misdemeanor and Should Not Be Taken Lightly**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most taxpayers file their tax returns on time, but sometimes they just stop filing altogether. Usually, this is due to a change in circumstances such as financial or emotional hardship.

Or, maybe they’ve misplaced the paperwork needed to file their return or were overwhelmed by the complexity of the new tax reform laws and just didn’t get around to filing this year. Whatever the reason, failing to take action only makes a bad situation worse.
