**We Specialize in Business Tax Preparation**
---------------------------------------------

As a business owner, you’re busy developing new products or services and making sure your business runs smoothly. You probably don’t have time to reconcile your bank account or generate balance sheets to manage your cash flow, let alone read up on the latest tax laws to find out which tax breaks you can take advantage of.

When you first started out, and money was tight, the do-it-yourself method of accounting might have worked just fine. But now that you have employees, pay estimated taxes, and need to manage your cash flow better, it’s time to find a trusted advisor to partner with all year long--not just at tax time.

### There’s no better time than now to discuss tax planning strategies that will help you build a foundation for future success.

**Here is what we do for you:**

*   State and federal income tax preparation and filing
*   Local and state sales tax compliance
*   State and federal payroll tax
*   Minimize tax liability through the use of proven tax planning strategies
*   Profit and loss statements
*   Mergers and Acquisitions
*   Entity selection and structure (S-Corp, C-Corp, LLC)

### Make Sure You Never Miss a Deadline Again

The IRS, as well as state and local governments, imposes strict deadlines for business tax obligations. Missing these tax deadlines and failing to comply with payroll and sales taxes negatively impacts your bottom line and may result in fines for non-compliance.

As your trusted advisor, we make sure you stay on top of your tax obligations and avoid penalties and fees that reduce your profitability.
