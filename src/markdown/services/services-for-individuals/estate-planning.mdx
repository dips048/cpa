**Estate Planning Is Not Just for the Wealthy…it’s for Everyone**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Planning for your family’s financial future is not just for the one percent; it’s important for everyone especially if you have a spouse or children. 

The reality, of course, is that most people do procrastinate and never get around to estate planning until it is too late. There are many reasons why this happens. Perhaps you are under the impression that it is too expensive. Maybe you just don’t want to think about death because it’s unpleasant or feel that because you are young and healthy, there’s plenty of time to worry about the future later.

Unfortunately, you could be wrong, and your family could be in for a surprise. Because if there’s no estate plan in place, then state laws dictate how your assets and property are divvied up -- not you or your family.
