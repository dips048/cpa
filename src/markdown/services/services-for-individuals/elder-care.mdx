**Helping Your Loved Ones Maintain Financial Independence When They Need It Most**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you have an elderly family member who needs help with day-to-day finances such as paying household bills or balancing a checkbook? Are you worried that financial predators might be taking advantage of your elderly parents?

If you answered yes, we are here to help.

As specialists in elder care accounting services, we provide financial services and support for seniors who might need help handling their finances, whether it’s managing assets to maintain wealth or paying household bills on time.

### Financial Support Services for Aging Seniors

Most adult children are too busy taking care of their own families, are too far away, or simply lack the specialized knowledge needed to be of much help.

When you work with an accounting firm specializing in elder care accounting services, you can rest easy knowing that your elderly family member's needs are being met.

*   Income tax preparation
*   Household budgeting including unexpected expenses (home repairs, emergency medical expenses)
