**Accounting Services for the Hospitality Industry**
----------------------------------------------------

Competitive and cyclical in nature, many restaurants and hotels operate on a slim margin subject to the whims of tourism trends, weather, and other factors beyond anyone’s control.

From assistance with financing options to structuring “the deal” and projecting revenues, it’s vital to use a tax and accounting firm that understands the financial and operational challenges faced by businesses in the hospitality industry.  

When you hire accounting and tax professionals that specialize in hospitality-related businesses, you get more than a general business accounting firm. We also handle industry-specific issues that arise such as state and local government tax incentives, R&D tax credits and other deductions that reduce your tax liability, and in-depth knowledge of repair regulations, as well as sales and use tax.
