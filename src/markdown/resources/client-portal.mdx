As a valued client, you get a secure, password-protected portal to store and access your important financial documents from anywhere at any time.

Whether you're at work, at home, or on vacation, you always have access to your tax returns, financial work papers, or accounting database.

This portal also allows us to work together efficiently by securely exchanging working documents, scanned receipts, and very large QuickBooks files.

Check out this video to see the portal in action. See how to use the SecureSend feature to quickly and easily send files to the secure portal environment. (View client portal [security measures](#).)

To start using the client portal please log in above or register here.  

To send a file without creating an account use the [SecureSend page](/resources/secure-send).
