### How can I get the best deal when hiring a moving company?

Even though your moving date may be months away, as soon as soon as the contracts are signed you should start getting recommendations for moving companies from friends or colleagues.

**Start calling movers for estimates.**  
Once you have a list of recommendations, call each one to get an estimate of how much your move will cost. You'll have to provide them with the number of miles involved in the move and the approximate weight of your belongings. The mover will help you in making this estimate.

**Ask about extra charges that apply.**  
Movers typically charge extra for flights of stairs, heavy items, pianos and other special items. Be aware of the fact that having the movers pack for you increases your moving bill by about 30 percent. You may also have to pay a premium if you schedule your move during busy moving times, generally after the 25th of the month or before the 2nd.

**Do not use a mover whose estimate seems too low.**  
The services provided may be second rate. If it seems too good to be true it probably is.

### How can I minimize problems when I move?

As soon as you schedule your move:

*   Tag any items you are leaving behind for the new owners.
*   If your move is job-related, find out whether your employer will reimburse you for part of the cost.
*   Save any receipts relating to the move since part of the cost will be deductible on your taxes when you file.
*   Start shopping around for a new bank in your new neighborhood.
*   Get a change of address kit from the post office and begin notifying people of your impending change of address. You will need to notify credit card companies, banks, and other financial institutions directly.
*   Call schools in your new location and enroll your children.
*   Get copies of your medical and dental records (and veterinary records if you have pets). Be sure your move is covered by insurance--either the moving company's insurance or your homeowner's insurance.
*   Call your insurance agent and take care of transferring homeowner's insurance to your new home.

As you get closer to the date of your move:

*   Call utility companies and give them a date to turn on service at your new home and terminate service at your old home.
*   Switch your direct payroll deposit, and any automatic payments, to your new checking account.
*   Two or three days before you move, take money out of your old bank account and transfer it to your new bank account. Be sure to leave your new address with the old bank.
*   Shop for auto insurance in the new area (if moving out of state).
*   Transfer your brokerage account to your new area if you use a local broker.
*   Defrost your refrigerator.
*   On moving day, check your contract with the mover. Be sure the total cost of the move is clearly detailed and that the moving date, location, and insurance information are all correct.
